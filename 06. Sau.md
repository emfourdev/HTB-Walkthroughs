## Reconnaissance

- Ran an NMAP Scan with the following command
	- `sudo nmap -sV -sC -oA initial -p- --disable-arp-ping 10.10.11.224`
- While that was running I checked to see if a webserver was running on Port 80 but it wasn't.
- SSH is running and accepting passwords
- The following ports were found
	- 22 - SSH - OpenSSH 8.2 p1
	- 80 - HTTP - This one is filtered so it must be behind a firewall
	- 8338 - Unknown - This is also filtered
	- 55555 - Unknown
- Browsed to 55555 and found it is a Web App called Request Buckets
- I spent a little bit of time trying to think of a way to exploit this. I googled Request Buckets thinking it might point me in some form of direction and it actually revealed that this isn't a custom app like I thought it was. It is a legit app.
- I also did a **dirsearch** just for giggles which returned some interesting finds which would come in handy later on.


## Weaponisation

- A quick look at source shows that it is version 1.2.1 and a quick google turned up a CVE for this version
	- CVE-2023-27163 - Server Side Request Forgery
	- In essense you can craft a request that will then be redirected to servers that are sitting on the local network. 
- I found a working PoC exploit and once I worked out how this actually worked I was able to get a response from the two services on Port 80 and 8338. 
- A service called Maltrail is running on those ports. 
	- Maltrail is a malicious traffic detection system
	- Digging through the response I found that it is running version 0.53
- A quick google turned up an RCE Exploit for this version
	- https://github.com/spookier/Maltrail-v0.53-Exploit
	- https://github.com/rvizx/maltrail-rce

## Delivery

- What I had to do now was workout how to send that exploit through to the server. I didn't quite grasp what the Request Bucket was doing. 
- I grabbed another exploit from 
	- https://github.com/entr0pie/CVE-2023-27163
- I ran this with
	- `./CVE-2023-27163.sh http://10.10.11.224:55555 http://127.0.0.1:8338`
- What I didn't realise was happening was the bucket was being created on the website and you could access it from there and it was essentially proxying the traffic through to the server behind. 
- So I created a new bucket pointing to the /login path on the MalTrail server because that is what you attack with the exploit. 
	- `./CVE-2023-27163.sh http://10.10.11.224:55555 http://127.0.0.1:8338/login`
- That created a bucket
	- http://10.10.11.224:55555/rnikdp that would proxy all traffic to http://127.0.0.1:8338/login

- I then used the mailtrail-rce exploit 
	- `./exploit.sh http://10.10.11.224:55555/rnikdp` whilst running a listener on my box

- This popped a shell

## Installation / Exploitation

- I'm logged in as user Puma
- Recovered the user flag in /home/puma
	- `f0c344fa1bd23101bd9ec611fc99b622`
- A quick check of Sudo and I can run `/usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service` as sudo without a password
- GTFO Bins has a PrivEsc exploit that works if you can run systemctl status as sudo
- At first I didn't understand their instructions but I did another google search and found
	- https://exploit-notes.hdks.org/exploit/linux/privilege-escalation/sudo/sudo-systemctl-privilege-escalation/
- Down the bottom it has the same exploit but explained it a little differently.
- The exploit
	- `sudo systemctl status trail.service`
	- While in the pager type `!sh` and press Enter and boom you now have a shell
