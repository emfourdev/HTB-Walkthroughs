## Reconnaissance

- Performed an NMAP scan
- Found Ports 22, 80 open
- The website takes you to a login portal
- Running best practical ticket management system version 4.4.4+dfsg-2 ubuntu1
- Used default credentials to get access
	- Username: root
	- Password: password
-  Browsing through the app found the following users
	- lnorgaard@keeper.htb
		- Heldesk Agent from Korsbak
		- New User initial password set to Welcome 2023!
	- root@localhost
- Logged in with the lnorgaard account
	- There was a ticket logged regarding the keypass system

## Weaponisation

- Logged in using the same account on ssh
- User flag recovered: `83bf6d3765232fd28b19862539cebe0a`
- Found a file RT 3000. Zip and downloaded it.
- Extracted the file and it contained a KeepPass DB and a Memory dump from KeepPass

## Delivery

- Did a quick search online and found an exploit that recovers the master password from a KeepPass memory dump
	- https://github.com/vdohney/keepass-password-dumper
	- Cloned to my kali box using:
		- git clone https://github.com/vdohney/keepass-password-dumper
		- Changed the SDK to 6.0 so it would work on my box
		- Ran it with dotnet run KeePassDumpFull. Dmp
		- Recovered the password: M}dgrød med fløde
- Tried using that password for the root account but didn't work.
- The exploit might get the first couple of characters wrong and the recovered password didn't work. 
- The walkthrough said to do some googling which I did and the word is actually Rødgrød med fløde
- The correct password was `rødgrød med fløde`

## Exploitation / Installation

- Used the KeeWeb app ( https://app.keeweb.info/ ) to open the database
- Root Password is `F4><3K0nd!` 
- This password didn't work. Instead there was also a Putty Private Key

- I messed around with this for a while because puttygen was complaining it was the wrong format. Turned out it was just because of the way I copied it from the app.
- After redoing it a couple of times I was able to use puttygen to convert it to an openssh key file
- `puttygen id_rsa -O private-openssh -o private`
- Then I used that to login to the server
- `ssh -i private root@10.10.11.227`

## Actions on Objective


- Root Flag recovered was: `0206efc93c1398aa5d7104ea2929b27b`
