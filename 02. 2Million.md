## Reconnaissance

- Nmap scan identified Port 80 and 22 open
- The website is running on nginx and redirects to 2million.htb
- Entered that into my /etc/hosts file and brought up the website.
- A quick scan identified a /login,/invite and /register these all brought up forms. 
- My inexperience in JS and what to look for showed as I got sidetracked looking for SQLi attacks. 
- I conducted a VHOST enumeration with nothing. 
- I then tried using Gobuster to enumerate directories but it would fail so I used dirbuster which found the following:
	- /
	- /images
	- /login
	- /invite
	- /js
	- /js/htb-frontpage.min.js
	- /assets
- Direct access to the folders was denied
- I floundered here for a little bit so took a look at walkthroughs and one mentioned using a bruteforce browser called feroxbrowser
- Installed that and ran it with
- `feroxbrowser -u http://2million.htb`
- It found some interesting things one of which was
	- `/js/inviteapi.min.js`
- I browsed to this script and even though I wasn't sure what i was looking at it mentioned at the bottom makeInviteCode. 

## Weaponisation

- I wasn't sure how to use this information but after a quick glance at another walkthrough you can enter that into the browser devtools and it'll run that function.
	- `makeInviteCode()` you need to remember to put the () at the end for it to work.
- It spat out JSON response with the following data
```
data: "Va beqre gb trarengr gur vaivgr pbqr, znxr n CBFG erdhrfg gb /ncv/i1/vaivgr/trarengr"
enctype: "ROT13"
```
- Inserted the returned data into a ROT 13 decoder and it returned the following information
	- `In order to generate the invite code, make a POST request to /api/v1/invite/generate`
- So I crafted a POST command using curl
	- `curl -X POST 'http://2million.htb/api/v1/invite/generate -H 'Content-Type: application/json'`
- That returned the following data:
	- `{"0":200,"success":1,"data":{"code":"QTRRMlItRkVRMEktSUo5RU0tSzFQSkE=","format":"encoded"}} `
- So the string is encoded but I don't know by what.
- I required a little prompting from the walkthrough which identified the encoding as base 64. I wanted to know how they knew this and it turns out I had that information in my notes. 
- The = at the end and only being alphanumeric gave it away.
- Used the the following command to decrypt the string
	- `echo QTRRMlItRkVRMEktSUo5RU0tSzFQSkE= | base64 -d`
- Returned `A4Q2R-FEQ0I-IJ9EM-K1PJA`
- Using this code I was able to register on the website

## Delivery

- Looking around and there's an option to generate an OpenVPN package but the package doesn't work.
- Using BURP to intercept you can see that it's using an API to generate, validate etc.. The generation of the VPN package. 
- In the Target window of Burp I browsed to the 2 million. Htb/api link which returns 
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx
Date: Tue, 05 Dec 2023 13:33:54 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: close
Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Length: 36

{"\/api\/v1":"Version 1 of the API"}
```
- That's pointing to different versions of the API and the one being used by the website is v 1 
- I browsed to /api/v 1 and that returned the following:
![[Screenshot 2023-12-05 at 5.39.48 pm 1.png|Screenshot 2023-12-05 at 5.39.48 pm 1.png]]
- This is a list of the different endpoints for the API. 
- What we're looking for is a way to inject command or code that will be run on the target. 
- From here I sent the API call to Repeater (right click on /api/v 1 -> Send to Repeater)
- Now I manipulated the api call to see what happens.
- Doing a `GET /api/v1/admin/auth` showed that the current user isn't an Administrator
![[Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 9.19.12 pm.png|Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 9.19.12 pm.png]]
- If I try the `POST /api/v1/admin/vpn/generate` It returns a 401 Unauthorised. So this must require some kind of authorisation to run.

![[Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 9.21.36 pm.png|Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 9.21.36 pm.png]]

- Looking through the other endpoints one that looks very interesting it `PUT /api/v1/admin/settings/update`. This might be able to be used to change my admin status.
- Running it returns a message stating an Invalid Content Type. 
- The Response has the content type set to application/json so let's give that a shot. 
- Added that to repeater and resent
- It's now telling me that I've got a missing parameter: email

![[Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 9.24.12 pm.png|Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 9.24.12 pm.png]]

- Inserting that into the request in JSON and the Response was that I was missing another parameter is_admin

![[Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 9.26.04 pm.png|Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 9.26.04 pm.png]]

- Added that to the response and took a guess that it would be a boolean value. This worked and returned an ID of 20.

![[Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 9.27.54 pm.png|Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 9.27.54 pm.png]]

- Now if I try to send `POST /api/vi/admin/vpn/generate` I get a Missing Parameter response instead of being unauthorised. The missing parameter is username.

![[Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 9.51.54 pm.png|Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 9.51.54 pm.png]]

- I add my username and resend and I now get the VPN package that is generated. 
![[Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 9.57.21 pm.png|Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 9.57.21 pm.png]]


- Now the certificate that is returned has to be generated server side. It can't be generated by a PHP script or Javascript. So the API must be running some kind of local script. 
- I needed a little prompting for this part. The script is likely some kind of bash script that takes the input of the username and generates the package accordingly. Something like gen_vpn. Sh -u username. 
- Now what we want to do is add an additional command on the end of that so we use ; and then put a # after everything to comment out any trailing commands.
```
{
	"username":"tester; id #"
}
```
- This worked and returned the id of the user

![[Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 9.57.40 pm.png|Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 9.57.40 pm.png]]

- So now I can do a little enumerating. I send the command `ls` to list the contents of the current directory. 
- Two files that look interesting Database. Php and index. Php

![[Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 9.59.29 pm.png|Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 9.59.29 pm.png]]

- Using the same trick I cat both files and the Database. Php is a wrapper script to connect to the DB but it doesn't contain any DB credentials. 
- The index. Php file references an .env file that looks like it pulls in a bunch of variables. 
![[Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 10.02.15 pm.png|Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 10.02.15 pm.png]]


- To check if the .env file exists I use `ls -a` and sure enough there it is
-
![[Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 10.03.21 pm.png|Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 10.03.21 pm.png]]

- A cat of that file reveals DB Credentials

```
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_DATABASE=htb_prod
DB_USERNAME=admin
DB_PASSWORD=SuperDuperPass123
```
- Now the MySQL DB wasn't exposed to the internet so I can't connect to it that way. 
- I could also establish a reverse shell from this backdoor. However, I figured I would give these credentials a try with SSH to see if they work. 
- And they do
- Recovered the User Flag
- 6023a4e9df19f77b799e8ad854b74cb4
- I then noticed that the user also has mail
- Used the command `less /var/spool/mail` and recovered an email that mentions they are in the process of an OS Upgrade due to some CVE's

## Exploitation

- A quick google for OverlayFS / FUSE CVE's brings up CVE-2023-0386 and CVE-2021-3493
- This affects kernels older than 6.2. This particular box is `5.15.70-051570-generic` so is likely vulnerable.
- Found a Proof of Concept at https://github.com/sxlmnwb/CVE-2023-0386
- Cloned the repo to my Kali Box and compiled it. 
	- I had to install some libraries using `sudo apt update && apt-get install libcap-dev libfuse-dev`

## Installation

- I then tarballed the exploit and uploaded it to the target using a Python Webserver
- Once the exploit was on the target I opened two terminals and ran the following in the first terminal
	- `./fuse ./ovlcap/lower ./gc`
![[Screenshot 2023-12-07 at 7.50.12 pm.png|Screenshot 2023-12-07 at 7.50.12 pm.png]]


- In the second I ran the following
	- `./exp`

![[Screenshot 2023-12-07 at 7.50.28 pm.png|Screenshot 2023-12-07 at 7.50.28 pm.png]]

- This executed the exploit and gave me sudo access

## Actions on Objective

- I was able to recover the root flag
